Spinoza's given name, which means "Blessed", varies among different languages. In Hebrew, it is written&nbsp;<span class="script-hebrew" dir="rtl">ברוך שפינוזה</span>. His Portuguese name is&nbsp;<em lang="pt" title="Portuguese language text">Benedito "Bento" de Espinosa</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em lang="pt" title="Portuguese language text">d'Espinosa</em>. In his Latin works, he used Latin:&nbsp;<em lang="la">Benedictus de Spinoza</em>.</p>
<p>Spinoza was raised in the Portuguese-Jewish community in&nbsp;<a title="Amsterdam" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a>. He developed highly controversial ideas regarding the authenticity of the&nbsp;<a title="Hebrew Bible" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_Bible">Hebrew Bible</a>&nbsp;and the nature of the&nbsp;<a title="God" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God">Divine</a>.&nbsp;<a title="Portuguese Synagogue (Amsterdam)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_Synagogue_(Amsterdam)">Jewish religious authorities</a>&nbsp;issued a&nbsp;<em><a title="Herem (censure)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herem_(censure)">herem</a></em>&nbsp;(<span class="script-hebrew" dir="rtl">חרם</span>) against him, causing him to be effectively expelled and shunned by Jewish society at age 23, including by his own family. His books were later added to the&nbsp;<a title="Catholic Church" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church">Catholic Church</a>'s&nbsp;<em><a title="Index Librorum Prohibitorum" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_Librorum_Prohibitorum">Index of Forbidden Books</a></em>. He was frequently called an "atheist" by contemporaries, although nowhere in his work does Spinoza argue against the&nbsp;<a title="Existence of God" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existence_of_God">existence of God</a>.</p>
<p>Spinoza lived an outwardly simple life as an optical&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Lens (optics)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics)">lens</a>&nbsp;grinder, collaborating on microscope and telescope lens designs with&nbsp;<a title="Constantijn Huygens Jr." href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantijn_Huygens_Jr.">Constantijn</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="Christiaan Huygens" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christiaan_Huygens">Christiaan Huygens</a>. He turned down rewards and honours throughout his life, including prestigious teaching positions. He died at the age of 44 in 1677 from a lung illness, perhaps&nbsp;<a title="Tuberculosis" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a title="Silicosis" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicosis">silicosis</a>&nbsp;exacerbated by the inhalation of fine glass dust while grinding lenses. He is buried in the Christian churchyard of&nbsp;<a title="Nieuwe Kerk (The Hague)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nieuwe_Kerk_(The_Hague)">Nieuwe Kerk</a>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<a title="The Hague" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hague">The Hague</a>.</p>
<p>Spinoza's&nbsp;<em><a title="Masterpiece" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masterpiece">magnum opus</a></em>, the&nbsp;<em><a title="Ethics (Spinoza)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_(Spinoza)">Ethics</a></em>, was published posthumously in the year of his death. The work opposed Descartes' philosophy of&nbsp;<a title="Mind&ndash;body dualism" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism">mind&ndash;body dualism</a>, and earned Spinoza recognition as one of&nbsp;<a title="Western philosophy" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_philosophy">Western philosophy</a>'s most important thinkers. In it, "Spinoza wrote the last indisputable Latin masterpiece, and one in which the refined conceptions of medieval philosophy are finally turned against themselves and destroyed entirely".&nbsp;<a title="Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Wilhelm_Friedrich_Hegel">Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel</a>&nbsp;said, "The fact is that Spinoza is made a testing-point in modern philosophy, so that it may really be said: You are either a Spinozist or not a philosopher at all."&nbsp;His philosophical accomplishments and moral character prompted&nbsp;<a title="Gilles Deleuze" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilles_Deleuze">Gilles Deleuze</a>&nbsp;to name him "the 'prince' of philosophers."</p>
